            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas in the fourth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, a right good and profitable Act was made to prevent the Transportation of all such Vnwrought Horns which the Company of Horners should be willing to buy; which Law continued in force until the First year of the Reign of Our Royal Grandfather King <hi>James</hi> of ever blessed memory; and being then Repealed, the Repeal thereof was soon after found to be so prejudicial to the Manufactures of the Realm, that in the Seventh year of Our said Grandfathers Reign, the same Law was again Revived and Reinforced, with the addition of a further Penalty of forfeiting the double value of all Vnwrought Horns which should be sold to Strangers, or sent beyond-Sea, as by the said Acts may appear. And whereas also Our Royal Father of ever blessed memory, by His Letters Patents, bearing date at <hi>Westminster</hi> the Fifth day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Third year of His Reign, did thereby Ratifie and Confirm unto the Wardens and Goodmen of the Company of Horners of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and their Successours, all the Powers and Priviledges in the said Acts contained, and did thereby strictly Prohibit all other persons to Sell or Transport any Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought Horns, contrary to the Tenor thereof: And further, by His Royal Proclamation bearing date the twentieth day of <hi>April,</hi> in the fourteenth year of His Reign, did command the said Laws to be put in execution; and that all His Officers and Ministers should be aiding and assisting to the said Company in the due execution of the said Laws, and of all other Powers and Priviledges to them granted by Authority of Parliament, or by any of His Majesties Letters Patents. And whereas We are Informed by the humble Petition of Our loving Subjects, the Master, Wardens, Assistants, and Fellowship of the Mystery of Horners of the City of <hi>London,</hi> That very great quantities of Vnwrought Horns are bought up by Strangers and others, and carried Vnwrought to the parts beyond the Seas, contrary to the aforesaid Statutes, and there Wrought into Manufactures, whereby very many persons in these Our Kingdoms do want Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and very many Families are brought to Poverty: We therefore of Our Princely Care, minding the advance and encouragement of Trade, the increase of Manufactures in these Our Dominions, the Imployment of the Poor, and the due execution of Our Laws, have thought fit by advice of Our Council, to declare this Our Royal Will and Pleasure, and do hereby strictly Charge and Command, That the aforesaid Statutes be put in their full execution; And that no Stranger nor Alien by himself, or by any other, do, or shall buy any <hi>English</hi> Horns Vnwrought, or Bunns of Horns Vnwrought, of any Tanners, Butchers, or of any other persons; And that none of Our Subjects, either Tanners or Butchers; or any other person or persons whatsoever, shall Sell, or put to Sale, any Horns Vnwrought, or Bunns of Horns Vnwrought, to any Aliens or Strangers; or send any Horns Vnwrought, or Bunns of Horns Vnwrought, either upon or with the Hides, or otherwise, to any parts beyond the Seas, upon pain of Our high Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and of such Penalties and Punishments as shall or may be inflicted upon the Offenders, for breach of the said Laws, and Contempt of Our Royal Will and Pleasure herein declared. And We do further Charge and Command all and every of Our Subjects, as well Natives as Foreigners, That they presume not to Transport, or cause to be Transported any Horns Vnwrought, or Bunns of Horns Vnwrought, nor to be aiding or assisting to any person or persons who shall endeavour to Transport the same, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost peril. And We do also straitly Charge and Command all Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, and other Officers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters whatsoever, attending in any of Our Ports, That they do from time to time cause diligent and strict Search and Inquiry to be made for all such Vnwrought Horns, or Bunns of Horns Vnwrought, as shall be endeavoured to be Transported, and the same to Seise and Detain until they may be viewed by some Members of the said Company, and not suffer the same to be redelivered, if any Member of the said Company will deal for the same at reasonable Prices, upon pain of incurring Our utmost Displeasure, in case they shall be found negligent or remiss in the execution of these Our Commands. And We do further Charge and Command all and singular Admirals, Vice-Admirals, Mayors, Iustices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Bayliffs, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Officers Civil and Military whatsoever, and all other Our loving Subjects, That they and every of them be from time to time aiding, helping, furthering and assisting to the said Master, Wardens and Assistants, and unto all and every the Members of the same Incorporation, in the Searching for all such Vnwrought Horns, or Bunns of Horns Vnwrought, as shall be endeavoured to be Transported, or which shall be brought to any place near the Sea-coasts, with intention to Transport the same, and in causing the same to be seised and detained as aforesaid, and in no wise to hinder or molest the said Master, Wardens, Assistants, and Fellowship, or any of them, in the due execution of the Powers, Authorities and Priviledges by the Acts of Parliament aforesaid, or otherwise by any of the Letters Patents of Our Father of ever blessed Memory, to them given and granted; as they and every of them will answer the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at their utmost perils: And that they do from time to time certifie unto the Lords of Our Privy Council, the names of all such persons whom they shall find to be Offenders against this Our Proclamation; To the end there may be such further proceedings against them, as shall be agreeable to the utmost severity of the Law in such cases. And We do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by straitly Charge and Command all Masters of Ships, Mariners, and all other Our loving Subjects whatsoever, and every of them, That they presume not at any time hereafter to receive into their Ships or Vessels, any Vnwrought Horns, or Bunns of Horns Vnwrought, with intent to Transport the same, contrary to the meaning of the said Acts of Parliament, and of this Our Proclamation, as they will answer the contrary at their perils.</p>
